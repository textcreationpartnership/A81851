            <title>A warning to the Parliament of England. A discovery of the ends and designes of the Popish partie both abroad, and at home, in the raising and fomenting our late war, and still-continuing troubles : in an oration made to the generall Assembly of the French clergy in Paris, / by Monsieur Jaques du Perron Bishop of Angolesme, and Grand Almosner to the Queen of England. Translated out of a manuscript copy, obtained from a good hand in France, and now published for the opening their eyes that hate not the truth, and that desire to be thankfull for such a discovery.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> be conÅ¿trained by the neceÅ¿Å¿ity and exigency of his Affaires, to come to an Accommodation with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled Subjects, as he will at laÅ¿t be inforced, and that in a very Å¿hort time, if He receive not Å¿peedy and effectuall Å¿uccors, That Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation will neceÅ¿Å¿arily bring with it, the totall deÅ¿truction of the Catholike Religion in that Kingdom. For as the firÅ¿t and principall Pretext, which the Parliamentarians Å¿erve themÅ¿elves off, to dreÅ¿Å¿e and colour over their Rebellion withall, and to Animate, Arme, and Unite all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects together againÅ¿t their Lawfull Soveraign, hath been, to make them believe that he was a Catholike, and that he would introduce, and bring the Catholike Religion into that Kingdom; And as the firÅ¿t Article of all the Treaties that have been Å¿et on foot, and put forward by them hitherto, hath alwaies been, that of the Ruine and Extermination of the Catholikes; it is not to be doubted, they will never conclude any Accord or Agreement with their Prince, but upon that rigorous Condition, that the little CatholiciÅ¿me that yet remaines there, Å¿hould for ever be BaniÅ¿hed from thence, and that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116160:3"/>all the Arms and Forces of England and Scotland Å¿hall be joyned together (as they have long Å¿ince reÅ¿olved amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, and publiÅ¿hed in Print) to execute this unhappy and wicked deÅ¿ign plainly, that is to MaÅ¿Å¿acre and cut the throats of all the poor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, as they have already begun to do in divers places; And to drown and extinguiÅ¿h for ever in their blood, the Remainders and reliques of Religion, not only in England and Scotland, but alÅ¿o in Ireland, where they have been almoÅ¿t all preÅ¿erved in the Orthodox belief, notwithÅ¿tanding all the perÅ¿ecutions that have been raiÅ¿ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t them for theÅ¿e hundred years laÅ¿t paÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Now the deÅ¿truction of Monarchy in England, and the EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Republike, and eÅ¿pecially of a Puritane Republike, which is the end that the Parliamentarians aime at, carrieth with it the greateÅ¿t prejudice that may be to the Catholike Religion: for the Extent of it will not be only in England, in Scotland, or in Ireland, but in all other parts of ChriÅ¿tendome. For if this Popular and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane State, Å¿hall once be formed in theÅ¿e three great Kingdoms, and after that Å¿hall Unite it Å¿elf with the Hereticks of <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as is moÅ¿t agreeable to all Maximes of State, Religion, and IntereÅ¿t, and w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to effect, they are eÅ¿pecially concerned, and which is a deÅ¿ign, which the Parliamentarians had formed in their mindes from the inÅ¿tant of their Revolt, and of which they now Å¿pare not to make a clear and open profeÅ¿Å¿ion: All theÅ¿e powers thus United by the IntereÅ¿ts of State, and of Religion, the moÅ¿t Å¿trict and Å¿acred bonds of humane Å¿ociety, will render themÅ¿elves Å¿o formidable to all the reÅ¿t of ChriÅ¿tendome, as they will be able in Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of time (if God Å¿hall not mightily interpoÅ¿e his hand) to undermine, and utterly to ruine all the Catholikes. And this is that which the Parliamentarians hope to come unto at laÅ¿t, when they Å¿hall have rooted up Monarchy from among themÅ¿elves, for they hate the Church, yet more then they hate Royalty. And is it not to be feared, that if the Catholikes of other Countreys, Å¿hall Å¿hew themÅ¿elves Å¿o little Å¿enÅ¿ible of the ruine of Religion in England, and Å¿hall not be ready to give their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance for the maintenance and preÅ¿ervation of the Å¿ame, that God by his juÅ¿t judgement Å¿hould permit that themÅ¿elves Å¿hould fall into the Å¿ame unhappineÅ¿Å¿e and miÅ¿ery of SchiÅ¿me and HereÅ¿ie, from which they have had no heart to preÅ¿erve and defend their brethren, and their neighbors? And is it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116160:3"/>not to be feared that God to puniÅ¿h our regardleÅ¿nes, &amp; looÅ¿enes in the things of his Å¿ervice, and of his glory, and our little zeal for the Augmentation, and ConÅ¿ervation of the Catholike Religion, Å¿hould permit the Å¿ame Catholike Religion to be wholly ruined, and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the reÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Countreys, in which it yet continueth in <hi>Europe,</hi> as in the Ages paÅ¿t, to chaÅ¿tiÅ¿e the Å¿ins of thoÅ¿e that lived before us, he hath permitted that it Å¿hould be wholly deÅ¿troyed, in all <hi>AÅ¿ia, Affrick,</hi> and the greateÅ¿t part of <hi>Europe</hi> it Å¿elfe, and to tranÅ¿plant it wholly into <hi>America,</hi> and that new world, which were the greateÅ¿t unhappineÅ¿Å¿e that could befall us; and which we ought to endeavour to hinder by all the meanes we can, all the dayes of our lives?</p>
            <p>The King of England hath promiÅ¿ed by a Letter which he hath written to the Queen his Å¿pouÅ¿e, to revoke and repeal all thoÅ¿e Laws which have at any time been made againÅ¿t the Catholikes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in caÅ¿e he can receive from the Catholikes any aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, to put him into a Condition of power and Authority to be able to do it. There is now no danger to declare this promiÅ¿e, which hath been kept Å¿ecret hitherto: for that the Parliamentarians having Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿ed the Copie of the Å¿aid Letter, have Printed and publiÅ¿hed the Å¿ame, to render the King the moÅ¿t odious to the People that they can; &amp; to render the Catholikes the moÅ¿t Å¿uÅ¿pects. And were not this now the greateÅ¿t good that could poÅ¿Å¿ible come to the Catholike Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For were not this to give and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h in a Å¿ort, the liberty of Catholike Religion in England? which if it were once eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed there, it is moÅ¿t certain that we Å¿hould Å¿hortly Å¿ee the greateÅ¿t part of that Countrey re-united to the Church: for there are now already a fourth part, yea, even near a third part, who are Catholikes, either Å¿ecret or open; There is one other third part, who are held in SchiÅ¿m, only from the apprehenÅ¿ion of temporall puniÅ¿hment, and the loÅ¿Å¿e of their goods, and by the fear of the Laws, which being once revoked, as the King of England promiÅ¿eth now they Å¿hall, in caÅ¿e he can be aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted, they would alÅ¿o preÅ¿ently embrace the Catholike faith. And who can tell whether the divine providence hath not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the King of England Å¿hould fall into thoÅ¿e difficulties, and extremities, into which he is now reduced, to the end, that being preÅ¿Å¿ed by the neceÅ¿Å¿ity and exigency of his Affaires, he might take this good reÅ¿olution, which God no doubt hath inÅ¿pired him with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116160:4"/>for the advantage of his Church? And who knowes whether when this King hath been Å¿o Å¿eaÅ¿onably and Å¿enÅ¿ibly engaged and obliged by the Catholikes, God may not take that occaÅ¿ion to touch his heart, and open his eyes to the light of the faith?</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd conÅ¿ideration, which ought to carry you more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and particularly to this aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance beyond the reÅ¿t of the Church, is your particular intereÅ¿t, that is to Å¿ay, the danger in which you are, in regard of your vicinity to England, as being neerer then any other Catholike kingdome; Å¿o as when HereÅ¿ie Å¿hall have ruined Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in England, it may with greateÅ¿t Å¿peed, paÅ¿Å¿e over to deÅ¿troy it alÅ¿o in France.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Res tua tunc agitur, paries cum proximus ardet.</hi> For we know of certain knowledge, that this is the deÅ¿igne and Å¿cope of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians; and that this is all the hope and the only refuge of the Huguenots; upon this hope it is, that they travell with Å¿o great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and vehemency, to help forward, and to publiÅ¿h the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Parliamentarians; 'Tis upon this hope they Contribute Å¿o great Å¿ums <note n="*" place="margin"> That the Reader be not miÅ¿taken in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, he is to take notice, that the Orator uÅ¿eth this as an Argument, to provoke the French Clergy to a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to the Queen in Emulation of the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots; wherein he impoÅ¿eth upon them, there never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Å¿o much as one peny ever leavied by them, or Å¿ent into England, for the uÅ¿e of the Parliament.</note> which they leavy upon themÅ¿elves, and Å¿ecretly convey into England. And truly this their hope perhaps is not Å¿o vaine nor ill grounded, as Å¿ome may be ready to imagine: for if the <hi>Huguenots</hi> at their firÅ¿t birth, and when they began to appear in this Kingdome, being only upheld by the protection of Å¿ome petty Hereticall Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> made themÅ¿elves in Å¿hort time Å¿o conÅ¿iderable, as they were able to Å¿et on foot at divers times Å¿uch Prodigious Armies, to give an hundred and an hundred encount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with our forces, to gaine many Å¿ignall Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to take a great number of the beÅ¿t Townes of this Kingdome, to keep whole Provinces intire, and to ruine and deÅ¿troy wherever they came the Catholike Religion, of which we Å¿ee yet, the lamentable marks and Å¿cars in all parts of this Kingdome, but principally in the DioceÅ¿es of <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc;</hi> what will it be, when beÅ¿ide the Å¿uccours of the Hereticks of <hi>Germany</hi> (who are now incomparably more powerfull then they were in thoÅ¿e times,) they Å¿hall be aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by the Puritanes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland and Ireland, united in one body of a Republike, the moÅ¿t formidable of all ChriÅ¿tendome? certainly it muÅ¿t be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116160:4"/>avowed, that all thoÅ¿e evils with which they have afflicted the Church of France in the times paÅ¿t, are nothing, in comparriÅ¿on of thoÅ¿e with which we are threatned for the future. The truth is, the <hi>Huguenots</hi> have been very much weakened, but they have not been yet intirely rooted out, they are yet in as great number, and have as great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿ity againÅ¿t us as ever; we have taken indeed from them their Towns, and Å¿trong places, but their hatred toward us remains, and their deÅ¿ire of Revenge Å¿till lives, and they attend but for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion to make the Å¿ame appear, which can never be preÅ¿ented to them more favorably, then by the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of a Puritane Republike in England; and therefore, if this Å¿hall ever come to paÅ¿Å¿e, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt it will come to paÅ¿Å¿e one day, if it be not preÅ¿ently and effectually hindred, we Å¿hall Å¿ee again in France, the Churches ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sepulchres profaned, the aÅ¿hes of the dead caÅ¿t into the wind, as they have done even to Å¿ome of our Kings and others. Behold, this is that which the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of France promiÅ¿e us, this is that which the Parliamentarians of England prepare for us, in caÅ¿e they can finiÅ¿h their work with their King and their Queen. Shall it be Å¿aid to poÅ¿terity? Shall it be Å¿aid to the Å¿hame of Catholikes, and particularly to the oprobry of the Clergy of France, that the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi> of France contributed Å¿o joyfully and freely, great Å¿ums for the aid of the Parliamentarians, that is to Å¿ay, for the enemies of God, of the holy. Church his Å¿pouÅ¿e, of your dignities and Å¿acred Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter? Å¿hall it be Å¿aid that they have made great Collections to Å¿end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, to help to deÅ¿troy, and root up from the foundation the Kingdom of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and to advance yet further, and Å¿et up there the Kingdome of Satan; hoping when that Å¿hall be effected to their mindes, to do the Å¿ame thing here in France: and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and eÅ¿pecially the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticks, who live only upon the Patrimony of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and who have proteÅ¿ted in their Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the face and preÅ¿ence of the whole Church, that they would renounce all the periÅ¿hable poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions of this world, and to have none other Inheritance then the Lord, no other PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, <hi>(Dominus pars haereditatis meae &amp; calicis mei)</hi> Å¿hould not a little retrench and abridge themÅ¿elves in Å¿ome Å¿mall thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to help and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the Å¿etting up of the Kingdome of the Å¿ame Lord and the Å¿ame IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in England, and to preÅ¿erve to him the Inheritance which he hath there purchaÅ¿ed to himÅ¿elf, at the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116160:5"/>Price of his owne moÅ¿t pretious blood, and with that of Å¿o many Martyrs, and by conÅ¿equence inevitable, to preÅ¿erve unto him here in France that kingdome, which he hath here poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed for theÅ¿e Å¿ixteen hundred years?</p>
            <p>I conclude this diÅ¿courÅ¿e with one conÅ¿ideration, which reÅ¿pects you yet more particularly then the reÅ¿t of the Church, in regard of the quality you bear as French. A ConÅ¿ideration nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e which the Queen of England hath even commanded me to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e, conceiving the IntereÅ¿t of her own perÅ¿on, and that of her children, of Å¿o Å¿mall conÅ¿ideration, as Å¿he dares not mingle them with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿ts of Religion. NotwithÅ¿tanding it Å¿eemed to me, that I could not omit it without breach of Piety and good Nature that is, to conÅ¿ider a little the eminent perill and danger, wherein the Queen of England and her children now are, to fall into a more deplorable and miÅ¿erable condition then ever perÅ¿ons of their birth and quality were reduced unto: to Å¿ee on the one Å¿ide Å¿ix young Princes and PrinceÅ¿Å¿es, the tendernes of whoÅ¿e age, is yet within the verge &amp; Limit of Innocence; Princes, which are the grand-children, Nephews, and CouÅ¿in Germans of our Kings; Princes, who derive their birth and blood from twenty or two and twenty Kings of England, and from twelve or fifteen Kings of Scotland, and who are generally allyed to all the Crowned heads of ChriÅ¿tendome, and of whom for that cauÅ¿e, it may as juÅ¿tly be Å¿aid, as of the children of the Emperors of <hi>ConÅ¿tantinople</hi> of old, that they were ingendred of Purple,
